Car Controller Simulation
This is a Windows Forms application that simulates a toy car's response to specific commands. The application demonstrates basic state machine principles, where the car changes its state based on valid command sequences.

Features
The car can process the following commands: start, stop, accelerate, right, and left.
The application identifies invalid command sequences, such as trying to accelerate or turn right when the car is in an idle state.
Displays errors if the command sequence is invalid or if an unrecognized command is entered.
Clears the input field automatically after each button press.
